# AoC 2023
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! The solutions are written in C++23 using Meson as build system. The solutions aren't optimized for speed, more for readability.

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#installation-using-python) and a C++23 std compatible compiler (e.g. GCC)

Then you can use meson to compile and than execute the solutions


```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
./build/aoc 01 -- or 02 etc.
```
